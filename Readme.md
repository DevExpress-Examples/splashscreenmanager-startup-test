Use this example to test the startup time of various [splash screens](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Core.SplashScreenManager?v=20.1) on your machine.

To change the splash screen type, uncomment one of the lines in App.xaml.cs and keep the other lines commented out.

The window title shows the time it took to display the splash screen.
